Developed and optimized a recurrent neural network (RNN) model for the classification of images of handwritten digits 
in the MNIST dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99% on the test set.
Preprocessed the image data by resizing and normalizing the images.
Conducted experiments to optimize the model architecture and hyperparameters, as well as data augmentation 
techniques to improve model performance.
Demonstrated proficiency in deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras, as well as computer
